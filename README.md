Hide LoLNexus Rankings
======================

Everyone knows that the rankings shown at <http://lolnexus.com/> can easily
throw you off, so I wrote a small userscript that (automatically) hides all
rankings while still leaving interesting information such as premades, runes and
masteries. And if you want, you can always show the rankings after the match has
finished, even though other sides like lolking or opgg are now also capable of
doing this (finally!)
.


Installation
------------

Note: This script was only tested on FireFox but should work on Chrome and Opera
too.

**Firefox**: Make sure you have the [Greasemonkey](Greasemonkey) extension
installed.

**Google Chrome**: Make sure you have the [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey]
extension installed.

**Opera**: To make this userscript run properly in the latest version of
Opera, download and install [Download Chrome Extension][dlchromeext]. After
that, make sure you have the [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] extension installed.

[Tampermonkey]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo
[Greasemonkey]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
[dlchromeext]: https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9

After this, you will be able to install the script by clicking the
installation link and selecting "Install".
