Hide LoLNexus Rankings
======================

Everyone knows that the rankings shown at <http://lolnexus.com/> can easily
throw you off, so I wrote a small userscript that (automatically) hides all
rankings while still leaving interesting information such as premades, runes
and masteries. And if you want, you can always show the rankings after the
match has finished.


Installation
------------

**Firefox**: Make sure you have the [Greasemonkey](Greasemonkey) extension
installed.

**Google Chrome**: Make sure you have the [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey]
extension installed.

**Opera**: To make this userscript run properly in the latest version of
Opera, download and install [Download Chrome Extension][dlchromeext]. After
that, make sure you have the [Tampermonkey][Tampermonkey] extension installed.

[Tampermonkey]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo
[Greasemonkey]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
[dlchromeext]: https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9

After this, you will be able to install the script by clicking the
installation link: **[Install Script][install]** and selecting "Install".
